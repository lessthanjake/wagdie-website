# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Next.js application for the WAGDIE project with Phaser game integration.

- `app/`: Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `components/`: React components
- `lib/`: Utility functions and shared logic
- `specs/`: Ralph v2 spec files (one topic per concern)
- `.storybook/`: Storybook configuration

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

> **Before you start:** read the Quick Start in `SETUP.md`. **Use Node 23.3.0** — pinned in `.nvmrc` and `package.json` so everyone runs the same runtime. For UI-only work, set `WAGDIE_API_BASE_URL=https://fateofwagdie.com` in `.env.local` and skip Supabase entirely; `middleware.ts` proxies `/api/*` to the deployed instance.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript, React 18, Next.js 15
