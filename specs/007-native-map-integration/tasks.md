## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: ✅ Complete
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: ✅ Complete
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: ✅ MVP working - minor improvements needed
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on T015 (WAGDIE icons) - Major missing: tooltips, popups, actual icons
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on layer control foundation - Missing: WAGDIE icons on controls, burn/death/fight markers
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on UI components from Stories 2-3 - Missing: WAGDIE font integration, animations
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Depends on popup component from Story 2 - Missing: staking integration, wallet filtering
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Independent - Needs responsive testing and mobile optimizations

### Within Each User Story

- Setup/verification tasks before implementation
- Core implementation before polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- T015, T016, T017 (US2 setup) can run in parallel
- T021, T022, T023, T024 (US3 setup) can run in parallel
- T028, T029, T030 (US4 setup) can run in parallel
- T034, T035, T036 (US5 setup) can run in parallel
- T040, T041, T042 (US6 setup) can run in parallel
- User stories 2-6 can be worked on in parallel once setup tasks complete (if team capacity allows)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 Implementation

```bash
# These can run in parallel:
Task: "Replace divIcons with WAGDIE icons in SimpleMap.tsx"
Task: "Create MapTooltip component in components/map/MapTooltip.tsx"
Task: "Create MapPopup component in components/map/MapPopup.tsx"

# Then sequential:
Task: "Add hover event handlers to SimpleMap marker creation"
Task: "Add click event handlers to display popups"
Task: "Implement smooth hover animations for markers"
```

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Current: MVP (User Story 1) is working
2. Once ready for next phase:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Interactive Markers)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Layer Controls) + User Story 4 (Asset Integration)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Character Location) + User Story 6 (Responsive)
3. Final phase: Polish together

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on User Stories 2-6 to complete the full feature set
- Error boundaries and performance optimization are critical for production readiness
- Test thoroughly on mobile devices before marking User Story 6 complete
